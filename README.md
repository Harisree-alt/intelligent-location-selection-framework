## 📌 Business Problem
Selecting the most suitable locations in Hyderabad for education franchise expansion using data-driven decision making.

## 📊 Approach
- Defined business-relevant indicators such as population, educational infrastructure, student ecosystem, and residential nature
- Assigned weights based on franchise decision priorities
- Converted indicators into relative scores
- Ranked locations using a weighted scoring model

## 🧠 Key Learning
- Importance of assumptions in real-world analytics
- How scoring models support structured business decisions
- Trade-off between data availability and decision urgency

## Week 5 Outcome
A weighted scoring model was applied to evaluate GHMC locations for education franchise expansion.
Kukatpally emerged as the primary recommended location, with Uppal as a strong alternative.
The model was stress-tested with minor weight changes and showed stable ranking behavior.

## Model Limitations
The analysis is based on approximate locality-level data and relative scoring.
Operational factors such as rent, competition, and regulatory constraints are not included at this stage.
